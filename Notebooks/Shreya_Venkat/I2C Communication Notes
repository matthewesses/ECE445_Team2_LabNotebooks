# Task 1: Implement I2C communication with the STM32

## I2C Basics:
- I2C has a master-slave setup, where the STM32 will be acting as the master and the components it needs to communicate with
are the slaves (LiDAR, Doppler, etc.)
- SDA (Serial Data) is the line on which the master and the slave communicate information.
- SCL (Serial Clock) is the clock line for data flow synchronization.
- Both of these lines are bi-directional.
