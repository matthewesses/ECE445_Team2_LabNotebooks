## 1/14-1/15 Project Ideation and Concept Development

### Initial Discussion with Mitchell
Before the class officially began, Mitchell and I discussed the primary aim of our project. We considered various factors such as the project's usefulness, the problem space it addresses, and the need for it to be enjoyable to work on.

### Exploration of Project Ideas
- **Remote Sensing Systems:** We both shared an interest in working with remote sensing systems like RaDAR and LiDAR.
- **Nintendo Switch JoyCon IR Camera Sensors:** Initially, I considered reverse engineering the Nintendo Switch JoyCon IR Camera Sensors for a wearable LiDAR system. However, due to challenges such as poor documentation, legal and ethical concerns, and the non-traditional problem space, this idea was abandoned.
- **ECE 445 Documentation Review:** Upon reviewing the documentation on the ECE 445 page, I realized the importance of the project being useful to someone, which led to a shift in focus.

### Final Project Concept: Wearable LiDAR for the Blind
- **LiDAR Principle:** LiDAR technology requires radial movement to generate a point cloud.
- **Initial Design Concept:**
  - Utilized a ring gear driven by two stepper motors.
  - Integrated LiDAR sensors into the ring gear, communicating wirelessly with a main computing unit.
- **Challenges and Abandonment:**
  - Power consumption concerns.
  - Feasibility issues.
  - Potential user discomfort.
  - Lack of practical usefulness.
